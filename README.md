# MacOS Debloater

*This is a project that allows you to remove all extra apps, bloat, and preinstalled junk off of your Mac!*

# *WARNING*:

Make sure to have an extra web browser and remember to back up your system! For maximum security I would recommend Firefox or Brave.

If you use MacOS for iCloud/business purposes then I would NOT RECOMMEND running this script, as it removes iCloud, Safari and more.

Also this is a new project, therefore it is still a work in progress!

# *How to use*:

# [Download](https://github.com/dotslashlevi/macosdebloater/releases/download/v0.1/debloat.sh)

# [Raw Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotslashlevi/macosdebloater/scripts/debloat.sh)

Search "Terminal" in Launchpad.

Click it and do the following commands:

cd Downloads/ *or wherever you downloaded the file*

chmod 777 debloat.sh

./debloat.sh

You are all done! After it finishes, it will automatically reboot for you. You now have a debloated MacOS system!
