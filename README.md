# MacOS Debloater

*This is a project that allows you to save space, and remove all extra apps, bloat, plus the preinstalled junk off of your Mac!*

# *WARNING:*

*I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES MADE TO YOUR COMPUTER, PAST THE POINT OF DOWNLOADING YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!*

Make sure to have an extra web browser and remember to back up your system! For maximum security I would recommend Firefox or Brave. This script does remove Safari.

If you use MacOS for iCloud/business purposes then I would NOT RECOMMEND running this script, as it removes iCloud, and a lot more.
