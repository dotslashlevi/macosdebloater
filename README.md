# MacOS Debloater

*This is a project that allows you to save space and speed up your Mac!*

The MacOS debloater is an open source alternative to most

big name apps which usually don't even improve speed.

It is meant to be a very small program, which helps

improve speed and usability while remaining lightweight.
