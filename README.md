# MacOS Debloater

*This is a project that allows you to save space and speed up your Mac!*

# *WARNING:*

*I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES MADE TO YOUR COMPUTER, PAST THE POINT OF DOWNLOADING YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!*

If you use MacOS for iCloud/business purposes then I would NOT RECOMMEND running this script, as it removes iCloud, and a lot more.
