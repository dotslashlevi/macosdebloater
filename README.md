# Make sure to have an extra Web Browser and remember to back up your system!
# If you use MacOS for iCloud/business purposes then I would NOT RECOMMEND running this script, as it removes iCloud, Safari and more.
# Also this is a new project, therefore it is still a work in progress!

# MacOS Debloater

# This is a project that allows you to remove all extra apps, bloat, and preinstalled junk off of your Mac!
