# How can I debloat my system?

*Note: You need SIP to be turned off.*

The way you install this is simple.

Click the green button that says "Code" with an arrow, then click Download ZIP.

Then you want to open your terminal.

Type the following commands.

```
cd Downloads/

chmod +x macos-debloater

./macos-debloater
```

The Computer will then interpret and run the script, and your system will automatically reboot.
